                    Investigators have found more used medical items being sold to desperate US Hospitals. The items range from medication cups, IV tubing, urinals, and syringes. A CEO of a local hospital that wished
                    to be <span class="anonymous">anonymous,</span> spoke out on the matter: 
                    <uL>
                        <span class="quote">"I regret to inform you that this story has affected our
                    community. We are working with CDC officials to make sure those who have come into contact with these contaiminated items were not harmed 
                    during this time."</span>
                    </uL>
                </p>
                <p> Much like the way SKYMED company dyed and washed the gloves, manufacturers <span class="bleached">bleached</span> many of the items, leaving them
                    brittle and breaking easily. In fact, this is what prompted investigators to search where these hospital items were shipped from. 
                </p> 

                <p>US officials are working closely with Thailand authorities to conduct a criminal investigation on the matter. </p>
